The program starts by defining a Task class representing the tasks that will be load balanced across different servers in the cluster. 
The Task contains an execute method that prints out the current threadâ€™s name as a placeholder for where the actual task logic would reside.

The LoadBalancer interface defines functions for adding servers and obtaining the next server for task distribution. 
The RoundRobinLoadBalancer class implements this interface, employing a round-robin strategy to evenly distribute tasks among the existing servers. 
This implementation maintains a list of servers and an index to monitor the current server in use.

The Server class emulates a server within the cluster, featuring a task queue and a designated name. The addTask function facilitates the addition 
of tasks to the server's queue, while the start method initiates a new thread to simulate task processing. This involves the sequential execution 
of tasks from the server's queue.

The DynamicLoadBalancer class serves as the cohesive element, integrating various components. It encompasses a LoadBalancer for task distribution, 
along with functions to incorporate servers and submit tasks to the cluster. The main method initializes the dynamic load balancer, generates servers,
and subsequently submits multiple tasks to the cluster. These tasks are then evenly distributed among the accessible servers through the 
load-balancing mechanism.

The central logic of the program focuses on the LoadBalancer, responsible for task distribution, while each Server processes tasks asynchronously. 
This simulation mirrors a dynamic cluster environment where tasks are evenly distributed across diverse servers, preventing any single server from 
becoming overloaded. The round-robin approach simplifies load distribution without the need for intricate algorithms, ensuring a balanced workload.
